# PIC18F47Q10 Receiving Data as a Slave SPI Device
In this demo, the SPI will be configured as slave and it will be used to receive data from a master device.

## Hardware Used
- PIC18F47Q10 Curiosity Nano [(DM182029)](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/DM182029)

## Setup
The PIC18F47Q10 Curiosity Nano Development Board is used as the test platform.

The following configurations must be made for this project:

|Pin           | Configuration      |
| :----------: | :----------------: |
|RA5 (SS)      | Digital Input      |
|RC3 (SCK)     | Digital Input      |
|RC4 (SDI)     | Digital Input      |
|RC5 (SDO)     | Digital Output     |

## Operation
Run the code, connect an oscilloscope or logic analyzer to the pins. In order to see the results, a master SPI device must be connected with the slave device. The data will be received on slave's SDI pin and will be stored in `receiveData`.
